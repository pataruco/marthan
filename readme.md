My dad was Pedro Marthan, a renowned Venezuelan actor, director, and professor. He passed away on the 18th of January 2021.

This website is dedicated to his memory and legacy.


## Development

This website is built using plain old HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am using Web Components to create reusable custom elements, such as a header, footer, and cookie banner.

It is built using Vite and deployed using GitHub Pages.

### Local development

```sh
pnpm dev
```

### Production build

```sh
pnpm build
pnpm preview    
```

## Deployment

To deploy the website, create a Git tag and push it to the remote repository.

```sh
git tag ivYYYY-MM-DD.VERSION
git push origin ivYYYY-MM-DD.VERSION
```
