My dad was Pedro Marthan, a renowned Venezuelan actor, director and professor. He passed away the 18 of January 2021

This website is dedicated to his memory and legacy.

## Development

This website is built using plain old HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I am using Web Components to create reusable custom elements, such as header, footer, and cookie banner.

Is built using Vite and deployed using GitHub Pages.

### Local development

```sh
pnpm dev```

### Production build

```sh
pnpm build
pnpm preview
```

### Deployment

To deploy the website, create a Git tag and push it to the remote repository.

```sh
git tag ivYYYY-MM-DD.VERSION
git push origin ivYYYY-MM-DD.VERSION
```
